            // that is part of the WSDL, that's just gonna be represented as a sequence of elements. and so 
            // on the client side , the client code generator has to decide how to map that back into .net code,
            // and by default they choose to use arrays insted of Lists. But we can change that later on.
            // Now one problem point was this array of evals instead of List of Evals at our service side

            // we csn do it by calling close() on the channel
            // channel.Close(); we won't find this method by default available to us,
            // because i will only see the operations made available on IEvalService,
            // In order to get the operation Close, we need to cast it to 'IClientChannel' interface.
            // Remember that all channels returned by CreateChannel will automatically implement iClientChannel,
            // as well as service contract type.
            // This is another problem area to cast channel to IClientChannel every time we had to use
            // Close or Abort operations. We talked earlier about special IClintChannel derived
            // interface to solve this problem. refer "Demo_Creation_using_closing_Channels"
